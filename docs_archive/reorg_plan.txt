# Archive Reorganization Analysis

Current structure has some organization but files at root level need categorization.

Root-level files (need organization):
- COMPLETE_FIX_SUMMARY.md - debugging history
- FIX_DTYPE_ISSUE.md - debugging history  
- FIX_NAN_ISSUE.md - debugging history
- FIX_RMSNORM_METAL_KERNEL.md - debugging history
- NUMERIC_STABILITY_TORCH_vs_MLX.md - debugging/lessons
- MLX_NUMERICS_LAB.md - experiments/testing
- DOCSTRING_ENRICHMENT_SUMMARY.md - task summary (cleanup candidate?)

Existing folders:
- architecture/ - design docs, analysis
- components/ - kernels, MAD system
- flowlang/ - experimental DSL
- plan/ - research notes, future work
- porting/ - platform-specific notes
- summaries/ - various summaries

Proposed new structure:
├── 01_debugging/          # Bug fixes and resolutions
├── 02_lessons_learned/    # Numerical stability, pitfalls
├── 03_architecture/       # Design docs (keep existing)
├── 04_components/         # Implementation details (keep existing)
├── 05_experiments/        # Flowlang, lab work, prototypes
├── 06_porting/            # Platform-specific (keep existing)
├── 07_research/           # Future work, analysis papers
└── 08_planning/           # Task summaries, milestones
