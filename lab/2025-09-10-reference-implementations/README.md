Reference Implementations (archived in lab)

This lab package contains third-party/reference xLSTM implementations moved out of the main tree for clarity. They are not used by production runners.

Folders
- pytorch_implementation/
- mlx_implementation/

Notes
- Kept for comparison and historical context.
- Prefer `xlstm_official_full` + `mlstm_kernels` for supported runtimes and `implementations/` for curated in-repo variants.
