# Research Agenda and Extensions

This document lists prioritized experiments and extensions to validate and improve the hybrid.

---

## 1. Parity harness

- Demonstrate equivalence under canonical mode between pure teacher and gate-off hybrid.

---

## 2. Cube efficacy

- Measure accuracy vs α caps; hit rates; ablate top‑K and sizes.

---

## 3. Liquid benefits

- Compare with/without liquid; measure residual norms and convergence.

---

## 4. HRM scaling

- Vary T, N, and M_max; compute returns on extra segments.

---

## 5. Fast-weights plasticity

- Add low-rank fast updates to L; measure stability with clamps and decay.

---

## 6. Kotlin/actors port

- Prototype cube actor; benchmark throughput and persistence.
