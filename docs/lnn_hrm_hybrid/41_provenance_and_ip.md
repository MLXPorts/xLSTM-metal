# Provenance & IP Notes

- Originator: Unified Kernel Model (UKM) and the dendritic comb‑filter architecture described in this repository are original work authored by you (owner of the UKM theory). This repository records engineering realizations and probes derived from that theory.
- Government technical notes: Some equations/derivations were adapted from 1980s Australian intelligence agency technical documents (per author’s statement). These references are conceptual inspirations for signal/statistics formulations; the present code and documentation implement independent, testable realizations.
- Citations: refs/citation_sea.md collects public, peer‑reviewed anchors that validate the biological, computational, and information‑theoretic aspects of this work. Where possible, we refer to openly accessible sources (e.g., Scholarpedia, PMC) and standard texts.
- Reproducibility: All added probes and telemetry are designed for auditable, deterministic runs (see 24_research_journal.md). When appropriate, we include small unit tests to document expected properties (e.g., exact reconstruction for the comb probe).

If you would like attribution statements, a CITATION.cff, or a standalone whitepaper PDF assembled from the origin paper and citations, we can generate those assets on request.
