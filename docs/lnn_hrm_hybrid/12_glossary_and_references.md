# Glossary and References

## Glossary

- ACT: Adaptive Computation Time; segment-level halting.
- Cube: Per-block associative memory of (key, residual) pairs with stats.
- Liquid (LNN): Continuous-time neural cell (e.g., LTC/CfC) with stable, explicit updates.
- HRM: Hierarchical Reasoning Model; two-timescale controller (H slow, L fast).
- Takeover: Gate promotes cube/liquid prediction over teacher under confidence.
- Residual clamp: Bound on update norm to ensure stability.
