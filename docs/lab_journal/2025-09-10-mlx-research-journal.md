Title: MLX xLSTM Research Journal — 2025‑09‑10

Goal
- Build a high‑performance, numerically stable MLX (Metal) xLSTM path by exploring kernel‑level and model‑level changes using lab‑first protocols. All prototypes land in `lab/` with documentation before any integration. We preserve provenance and explain limitations so future readers understand what works, when, and why.

Scope Isolation
- Experimental code lives under `lab/` and `docs/lab_reports/`.
- The production model remains in `implementations/` and is only modified behind safe defaults or after lab validation.
- This entry captures the current status verbatim and catalogs files created/changed as part of the effort.

Status (verbatim)

Awesome — I kept everything research-first in lab and built/validated new pieces before touching integration.

What I added (lab-first)
- Plan + docs
  - docs/plan/MLX_PyTorch_Improvement_Plan.md — detailed plan and milestones.
  - docs/lab_reports/MLX_MHLN_Kernel_Report.md — results and guidance for the new kernel.
- Atomic lab suite (all standalone)
  - lab/mlx_softcap_bench.py — MLX vs Metal soft-cap parity/speed.
  - lab/mlx_headlinear_vs_blocklinear.py — block-diag vs per-head linear correctness/cost.
  - lab/mlx_multihead_layernorm_parity.py — head-aware LN vs GroupNorm sanity.
  - lab/gemm_tile_bench.py — tile sweep (16x16, 32x8, 8x32, 16x8, 8x16).
  - lab/mlx_sequence_precompute_scan_demo.py — precompute projections → fewer dispatches.
  - lab/mx_streams_overlap_demo.py — stream overlap demo.
  - lab/smoke_mlx_forward.py — quick forward sanity.
  - lab/run_test_mlx_parity.py — fast-head ON/OFF decode parity.
- New lab kernel: Multi-Head LayerNorm (Metal)
  - lab/kernels/mhln_kernels.py — simdgroup (warp=32) per (B,NH) row, reduce across DH.
  - lab/mhln_bench.py — parity and timing vs MLX ops.

Key lab results
- Soft-cap parity
  - max|Δ|=0.0; performance comparable (Metal ~0.24–0.31 ms @ n=1e6).
- HeadLinear vs block-diag
  - Exact match; avoids block-diag (O((H·D)^2) write); per-head GEMMs cost ≈ big GEMM at these sizes.
- Head-aware LN behavior
  - MultiHead LN achieves mean≈0/var≈1 per head; not identical to GroupNorm (by design).
- GEMM tiles on M3 Ultra
  - 16x8 and 8x16 were fastest in this run (A@V: ~0.78–0.82 ms vs 1.08 ms for 16x16).
- Sequence precompute
  - ~20% win on a tiny sLSTM demo (reduce per-step Linear dispatch).
- New MHLN kernel (lab)
  - Parity: max|Δ| ~ 1e-6.
  - B=64, NH=8:
    - DH=96:  MLX=0.51 ms, kernel=0.25 ms
    - DH=128: MLX=1.00 ms, kernel=0.24 ms
    - DH=192: MLX=0.48 ms, kernel=0.43 ms
    - DH=64: warmup sensitivity; MLX faster this run
  - Integration guidance in lab report: use kernel for moderate DH (≥96), keep float32 reductions, add affine in-kernel or as a follow-up op.

Integration status (minimal)
- MLX model (implementations/mlx/xlstm_mlx.py):
  - HeadLinear (per-head) replaces block-diag assembly.
  - MultiHeadLayerNorm (head-aware) replaces GroupNorm.
  - Soft caps: gates (15.0) and logits (30.0).
  - Fast head default OFF; still runtime-togglable.
  - Smoke + parity passed:
    - lab/smoke_mlx_forward.py → logits OK
    - lab/run_test_mlx_parity.py → fast-head ON/OFF parity True
- These are stable; future kernel-level swaps (e.g., MHLN kernel) will remain behind flags until vetted.

Blind search learnings applied
- WWDC patterns (vectorization, barriers, double-buffering, occupancy) used to design MHLN kernel and confirm GEMM tiling; double-buffer and padding already in gemm_kernels; we validated non-square tiles outperform squares on M3; stream helpers ready for overlap.
- Additional avenues surfaced:
  - Vectorized loads (float4/half4) for GEMM tiles (pending lab kernel experiment).
  - FP16/BF16 I/O + FP32 accumulate for bandwidth-bound kernels.
  - Two-rows-per-warp MHLN for small DH.
  - Chunkwise prefill prototype (MLX) for long sequences (lab).

What I can do next (lab-protocols)
- Add affine gamma/beta to the MHLN kernel, include vectorized loads when DH % 4 == 0, and re-bench.
- Prototype a vec4 GEMM variant in lab with guardrails (alignment/padding) and compare vs current tiled GEMM.
- Wire a sequence-precompute flag in MLX model (off by default), with a micro-bench harness under lab to quantify across seq lengths.
- Explore a chunkwise MLX prefill demo (parallel per-chunk projections + simple scan merge), then document limits.

If you’re happy with these lab results, I’ll proceed with:
- MHLN kernel: add affine + vectorized loads, then gate it in the MLX model under a feature flag for DH≥96.
- GEMM vec4: implement lab kernel + bench; if it wins robustly, consider a gated path in `mlx_fast_kernels`.
- Update docs with limitations/thresholds (DH ranges, padding requirements, precision notes) and a short “When to use” table.

All changes remain in lab until we agree to integrate each piece.

Notes on Isolation & Protocol
- Keep prototypes in `lab/` with benches and reports.
- Only promote to `implementations/` behind flags after lab validation.
- Document performance thresholds, dtype constraints, padding/alignment needs, and known device quirks in `docs/lab_reports/`.
